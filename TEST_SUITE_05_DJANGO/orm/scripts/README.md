This is base on BugBites ORM Deep Dive video series.

I have added in PyBoxen to pretty up console output

Code used is in `bb__02_01.py` for example which means video 02 part 01 if needed.

To run use python manage.py runscript <filename> but no .py extension e.g. `python manage.py runscript bb_02`

`management\commands\create_data.py` has scripts for loading data. Run with `python manage.py create_data`.
